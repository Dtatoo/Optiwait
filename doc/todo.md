# Todo list  
-[x] standerize rename init function for elm. Some are still using model function  


## Clinic Controller  
-[] add location to create user repo  
-[] update user repo still needs following items  
  - hours  
  - location  

## Elm  

-[x] Currently application model initialization only handles `AppModel` type. This should be more generalized to handle `(AppModel, Cmd Msg)` type.
